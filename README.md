# Calculator JS

I have realized a [classic calculator](https://confesssa.github.io/calculator-JS/) using JS. It has basic functions (multiplication, division, addition, subtraction), as well as a decimal separator, root extraction (square, cube, and so on), exponentiation, the undoing of the last input and the ability to work with both positive and negative numbers.

Tools: HTML, CSS, JS.
